> Finland is the first country in the world to publish its own set of country themed emojis. The Finland emoji collection contains 30 tongue-in-cheek emotions, which were created to explain some hard-to-describe Finnish emotions, Finnish words and customs.

> The emojis are part of the Christmas calendar published by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland on this site. We are THE Christmas nation, because the original Santa Claus comes from Finland! The first calendar hatch revealing the first emoji explanation opens on 1 December. On top of the 24 calendar hatches there will be general Finnish emojis released. If you wondered, why we only have 24 hatches on the calendar instead of 25, it is because Christmas is celebrated in Finland on the Christmas Eve, not Christmas Day.
